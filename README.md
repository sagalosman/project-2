# Splash | 48 hr Hackathon

# Overview. 

This was my second project in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. It followed a week of learning about React and so it was a real test of how quickly I had picked up the language. This project was completed just under 48 hours. You can launch the app on GitHub pages here.

# Brief

The app had to:
* Consume a public API.
* Have several components, at least one classical and one functional.
* The app should include a router and at least two pages.
* Include wireframes that were designed before building the app.


<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (ES6)
* React
* APIs
* Insomnia
* Git and GitHub

# Approach

We looked at the various APIs that were available and decided that with a wealth of APIs that focus on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, we could build an app that gave up to date Bitcoin prices compared to some of the key international currencies. The app uses APIs from Coindesk, Blockchain, Coingecko and Deezer.

The first page is relatively simple - we display the value of a Bitcoin compared to a British pound. On the second page we added other currencies to give a broader level of information.

And just for fun, when the second page plays the theme song from the film Wall Street. For this we used the Deezer API.
